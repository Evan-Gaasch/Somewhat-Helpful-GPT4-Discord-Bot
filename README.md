# somewhat-useful-discord-chatbot
This is a project I made for fun. It uses the discord and openai api to create a 'useful' discord bot that replies in a confusing and tedious fashion. This is designed as a joke and also an exercise in prompt engineering.


To get this to work, you need a free (or paid) trial of the Openai API. You also need to go and make a discord bot on the discord developer page. Insert the bot token and the api key into the spots listed in the code to have this work. 

Modify the "instructions" variable in the main code to change the bot's instructions.

WARNING:
This code is merely a proof of concept for my future projects and the prompt is designed to be humorous rather than useful.
